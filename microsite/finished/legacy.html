                    Curry is considered by many to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.[2][215][216] He is credited
                    with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring basketball teams, from high school to the
                    NBA, to regularly utilize the three-point shot.[3][4][5] Analysts have referred to him as "the
                    Michael Jordan of the three-point era," stating that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did
                    for the dunk.[217][218][219] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013 game
                    against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a
                    54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[220] The era has been referred to as "The
                    Steph Effect"[5] and "the NBA's Three-Point Revolution."[221]
                    <br><br>
                    Before Curry, shooting behind the three-point line was more of a novelty, an occasional way of
                    scoring.[216][222] Catch and shoot players existed, but Curry's success inspired the league to
                    abandon physical play around the basket and to embrace a pace and space and three-point shooting
                    style.[222] The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in
                    their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people
                    wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.[5][220] Although this has led to players becoming good at
                    or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is
                    unique.[5] Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.[216] He shoots 54 percent from
                    this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between
                    30 and 35 feet.[216] He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with
                    an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.[222]
                    Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does
                    takes work and time.[5] Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that "coaches have to explain
                    that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals" and that
                    "while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays,
                    the root of their success is ball movement."[5]
                    <br><br>
                    Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that "one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range" and that
                    "Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever."[216]
                    Sally Jenkins of The Washington Post stated that he "moves around behind the three-point line in an
                    ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh
                    laundry in a breeze" and that a highlight is the "sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate
                    at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them." She said that "in one stretch he hit a
                    mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet."[206] Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that
                    Curry's hand-eye coordination "is as great as anyone I've ever seen."[206] Jeff Austin of Octagton
                    concluded that Curry "had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that
                    form from 40 and 50 feet."[206] Goldsberry stated that "no player in the history of the NBA has
                    combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry" and that "Curry's jumper is so
                    lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet."[216] His range and
                    efficiency drove the developers of the NBA 2K video game series, in which Curry is featured, to
                    worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen.[222]
                    Where Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate.[223] Former
                    NBA player Steve Nash, who is also among the NBA's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is
                    "already an all-time great" and that people question his greatness "because he doesn't dominate the
                    game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates."[223]
                    Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's "willingness to
                    sacrifice for [Kevin Durant] is one of the great stories in history" because Curry welcomed Durant,
                    who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego. "If you have a mind for the game, you know
                    that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't
                    win," he said, crediting Curry with being "one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen."[223]
                    CBS Sports ranked Curry #19 in their list of "50 greatest NBA players of all time".[224] Sports
                    Illustrated ranked him #3, behind Durant and LeBron James, on their "Top 100 NBA Players of 2019"
                    list.[225] Sports Illustrated stated that "Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and
                    system" and that "the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to
                    dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any
                    reasonable expectation."[225]
