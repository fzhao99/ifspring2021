                <p>
                    Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at
                    a Davidson alumni event, "Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special."[19] In his first
                    collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers.
                    In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out 4 assists, and grabbed 9
                    rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per
                    game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas.
                    Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference
                    regular season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against
                    Furman, Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman
                    season record for 3-point field goals.[20]

                    Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on
                    February 6, 2007.[21] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13 seed set
                    to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70.[22] At the end of his
                    freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and
                    selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and first team All-SoCon. He was also
                    honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for
                    the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8
                    rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.

                <p>
                    In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and
                    again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7
                    rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular season record, and
                    a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third
                    straight NCAA Tournament bid.

                    On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early
                    in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[23] to push Davidson to their
                    first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going
                    8-for-10 from 3-point range.[24] On March 23, Davidson played second seeded Georgetown in the second
                    round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy
                    favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first
                    half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led
                    Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.[23]

                    On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored
                    33 points as Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8.[25] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry
                    Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four
                    career NCAA tournament games.[25] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season
                    record for most three-pointers with 158.[26][27] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the
                    top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in
                    the game but Davidson lost 57–59, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[28]

                    Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named
                    to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[29] He also was named the Most
                    Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA Tournament, becoming the first player from
                    a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[30] Curry was
                    nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[31]

                <p>
                    After Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would
                    return for his junior year.[26] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely
                    position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78
                    loss to Oklahoma.[32] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh
                    straight game.[32] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30
                    points, in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop.[33] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held
                    scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and
                    just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the
                    game 78–48.[34] In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career high of 44 in a
                    72–67 win over North Carolina State.[35]

                    Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points
                    against Samford.[36] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over
                    Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only
                    game he missed in his college career.[37] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time
                    leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points
                    for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[38] Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern
                    Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the
                    conference.[39][40]

                    In the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals
                    and won 84–68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference
                    tournament history.[41] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points
                    but Davidson lost 52–59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach
                    Bobby Cremins,[42] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the
                    sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first
                    round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70–63.[43][44] Davidson then fell
                    68–80 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, 9 rebounds, and 5
                    assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[45]

                    In his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the
                    NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American.[46] Curry opted out of his
                    senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[47]
