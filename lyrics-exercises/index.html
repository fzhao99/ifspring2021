                        <p class="twitter-reply">
                            I was the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000
                            hugs.
                            As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if
                            10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by
                            natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs acting as a collective group, are capable of
                            embracing
                            a human being 1,000 times without difficulty. By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs
                            in
                            such vast numbers form a sort of “swarm,” and a swarm can collectively surround a human and
                            deliver
                            a “hug” that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply
                            cannot.
                            Consequently, I was embraced 1,000 times by 10,000 luminescent insects. This may seem
                            inconceivable due
                            to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the
                            Lampyridae
                            insect family. Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the
                            possibility of
                            this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra
                            protruding
                            outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this
                            exchange.
                            I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in
                            the chemical
                            reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the
                            presence of
                            oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or “glow” because they were
                            happy to
                            be hugging me.

                <h2 class="explanatory-question">What inspired the song?</h2>
                In an <a class="read-more no-underline" href="#">interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, Adam Young
                (a.k.a. Owl City) stated:

                <blockquote>“Fireflies” was inspired by a camping trip I took up to a totally rustic and kind of remote
                    lake in northern
                    Minnesota, where there isn’t really much of anything. I can remember sleeping out on a dock on the
                    edge of this
                    lake and looking up at the sky. There was a meteor shower that night. I remember thinking, what a
                    cool idea of
                    shooting stars being fireflies, and trying to translate that into music. That’s what spurred it on.
                    I was also
                    influenced by the lack of sleep that tends to happen."</blockquote>

                The song <a class="read-more no-underline" href="#">topped</a> the Billboard Hot 100 for two
                non-consecutive weeks in 2009.
                The song became Owl City’s only song to top the Hot 100.
