            Fudgy Brown Butter Matcha Brownies
        </h1>

        <p> My love affair with matcha continues with these brown butter matcha brownies. I think I am on a crusade to
            matchify every classic dessert, and I am #notsorry about it! The reason I love adding matcha to desserts is not
            only for the vibrant green color or that smokey aroma of matcha. I love doing it because it helps balance out
            the sickening sweetness that exists in a lot of desserts. Case in point, brownies. Brownies are an amazing
            dessert, but most of the time, I can only have one piece because of how sweet most brownies are. Adding matcha
            to a classic brownie recipe balances out that sweetness, making it possible for you to have TWO instead of one.

                <h3 class="section-title"> Making my matcha brownies </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 8×8 baking pan with butter and line with parchment
                        paper. Set
                        aside. Next brown your butter. Heat unsalted butter over high heat until all the butter has melted.
                        Then
                        lower the heat to low and cook until brown bits start to appear. Remove from the heat. Next add
                        white
                        chocolate to a small bowl. Sift in the matcha powder. Pour the browned butter over the top and stir
                        until a
                        uniform green ganache appears. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Combine granulated sugar, light brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. Use a
                        hand
                        mixer to whisk the mixture until it is thick and cream (5-10 minutes). While mixing, stream in your
                        matcha
                        chocolate ganache. Whisk until a uniform green mixture appears. Lastly, sift your flour into the
                        bowl. Using
                        a spatula, gently fold the flour into the green mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter too
                        much. Mix
                        until just combined. Spoon the batter into your prepared pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake brownies for 20-30 minutes. After 20 minutes, take out the brownies and smack the pan onto a
                        flat
                        surface to get rid of some of the air bubbles. Sprinkle some flaky salt on top and put them back in
                        the
                        oven. Bake for another 10 minutes. Let brownies cool for 20 minutes before serving.
